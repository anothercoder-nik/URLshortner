- 🔗 Create custom short URLs (for registered users)
- 📊 Track click statistics for your shortened links
- 👤 User authentication system
- 📱 Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- 🔒 Secure API with JWT authentication

## Architecture

This project follows a clean, modular architecture that makes it production-ready:

### Backend Architecture
- **Controller-Service-DAO Pattern**: Separation of concerns with controllers handling requests, services containing business logic, and DAOs (Data Access Objects) for database operations
- **Middleware-based Authentication**: JWT verification through middleware for protected routes
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with custom error classes
- **Environment Configuration**: Externalized configuration using dotenv
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Clear separation between data models, business logic, and API endpoints

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-Based Structure**: Reusable UI components for maintainability
- **State Management**: Centralized state with Redux Toolkit
- **Data Fetching Layer**: Abstracted API calls with React Query
- **Route Management**: Declarative routing with TanStack Router
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

This modular approach ensures:
- 🔄 Easy maintenance and updates
- 🔌 Scalability for additional features
- 🧪 Testability of individual components
- 🚀 Simplified deployment process
- 👥 Collaborative development with clear boundaries
